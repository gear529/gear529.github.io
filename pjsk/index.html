        <p> If you're here, you probably want to get better at Project Sekai, or just want to know what it is.</p>
        <p> First of all, as an introduction, Project Sekai is a videogame made by Crypton, the company that made Vocaloid (more on that later), and Colorful Palette, a child studio of Craft Egg (who made another Japanese rhythm game by the name of "Girls Band Party!" or "Bandori") </p>
        <p> Vocaloid is a voice synthesis program where the user can make a selection of voices (most of which are derived from voice providers) sing or say whatever they please. Coming in a variety of languages, people all around the world love Vocaloid music. </p>
        <p> So, what is Project Sekai? It's a story, gacha, and rhythm game, all at once, along with virtual concerts being held regularly.</p>
