<h3>Usually found in tropical areas,</h3>
<p>this sea slug (yup, it's a sea slug!) actually feeds off the venomous Portugues Man o' War, as it's immune to it's venom. It has a gas sac in it's stomach, which makes it float upside down. What a silly little guy.</p>
<p> It uses the venom that it's gathered from the Man o' War as well as other venomous sea animals, stores them in it's finger-like cerata that will result in a painful sting if you touch it. The symptoms that can arise after contact with the G. Atlanticus include but are not limited to:</p>
<ul> ⋅ Nausea </ul>
<ul> ⋅ Pain </ul>
<ul> ⋅ Vomiting </ul>
<ul> ⋅ Vesicle formation </ul>
<p> As well as others. Don't mess with little guy.</p></h4>
