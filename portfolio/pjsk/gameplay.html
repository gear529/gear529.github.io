        <p>As I said, Colorful Stage is a gacha game, rhythm game, and has a story aspect to it.
        There are 5 units in the game, not including the Virtual Singers (Vocaloids).</p>
        <p>These groups consist of:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Leo/need</li>
            <li>MORE MORE JUMP!</li>
            <li>Vivid BAD SQUAD</li>
            <li>Wonderlands x Showtime</li>
            <li>25ji, Nightcord de.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p> These groups all have a certain musical genre with them. Leo/need is rock,
        MORE MORE JUMP! is a pop girl group, Vivid BAD SQUAD is a hip hop group, Wonderlands x Showtime is
        a theater based group, and 25ji's music is just.. very, <i> very </i> sad music.</p>
        
        <p> The way you get gems, the currency for the gacha section of the game, is by playing songs well
        (based on combo and score) and by reading the stories for the 5 units. Once you get a 4 star,
        the highest level of card in the game, you'll see yourself getting more gems. The more gems you get,
        the more cards you can get for different units, which will unlock the stories corresponding to those units.
        When you get more stories, you get Music Cards, which will therefore get you more songs, leading to more gems!</p>
        
        <p> For example, if you get a Haruka Kiritani card, then you will get points for MORE MORE JUMP!, which is the group she is in.</p>
